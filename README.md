## Purpose of the project: 
Demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set so that it can be used for later analysis

## Goals of the assignment:
1. Tidy data
2. Link to the Github repo with your script for performing the analysis
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
4. Include a README.md in the repo with your scripts where it explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected

## The R script created run_analysis.R will:
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
